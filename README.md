Project requirements: (Need to improve)
- Implement k-nearest neighbors on a new dataset and train a model on it
- Dataset: Include 3 part
	 1. Training set: This is the dataset that the model is trained on 
	 2. Validation set: The dataset to evaluate the model performance before going to the real test, normally, if the model is failed in the validation, it should be reevaluated and retrained.
	 3. Testing set: What is the expected output? -> The model accuracy! If the accuracy is too low, then make improvment on the algorithm (aka code) and the data (quality? quantity?). Normally, the acc should not be too high (Surely < 100%, but from the lecturer ... Viet, it should falls btw 30% - 90%).
